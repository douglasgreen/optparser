# To do
1. Combine all classes into OptPaser interface.
2. Make commands required.
3. Enable argument chaining.
4. Add a useAll() function.
5. A program may have two usages, one of which has a parameter required, and the other has the parameter optional. So move the required or optional setting to the add usage step. And add functions for all required and all optional.
